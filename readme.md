# Wolfram|Alpha PHP Wrapper

This is a PHP Wrapper for [Wolfram|Alpha](http://wolframalpha.com) APIs (V2), the computational knowledge engine made by Wolfram Research.

I made it because the one on the official website was missing some parts and methods that, in my opinion, I find necessary and useful.

In this readme file I will explain how to setup and use it in your PHP project.

## Introduction

In order to work with Wolfram|Alpha Engine API, you must have an AppID. To have an AppID, you must be [registered as a developer on the Wolfram|Alpha Developer Portal](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signin.html). It is a really simple procedure: when registered, all you will have to do is to create a new application, specifying a name and a description.

Actually, you can have 2000 monthly API free calls. If you don't like this, [get in touch with Wolfram](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/) to find a solution for your needs.

## How to Install the Wrapper

Installing the Wolfram|Alpha PHP Wrapper is very easy. In your project, just add this to your **require** element in _composer.json_. 

    {
        "require": {
            "francescomalatesta/wolframalphaphp": "dev-master"
        }
    }

If you don't know what Composer is, [it's time to do something about it](https://getcomposer.org/)! :) 

Just a _composer install_ and your done: now let's move to the Engine class.

## The Engine

The _Engine_ class is your access point to send your queries to the Wolfram|Alpha Engine. You can initialize it with this simple syntax.

    $engine = new WolframAlpha\Engine('YOUR_APP_ID');

Nothing more.

### process()

You can send a query to the engine with this method. Here's the signature.

    public function process($query, $assumptions = array(), $formats = array('image', 'plaintext'))

In _$query_ you will have to put the query you want to send (for example: ["who is buying a stairway to heaven?"](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=who+is+buying+a+stairway+to+heaven%3F)).

In _$assumptions_ you will be able to specify one or more assumptions to apply to the query. If you don't know them check out the [API Documentation](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation.html#6) and the end of this readme.

In _$formats_ you will put the desired format for the request output. By default you have _image_ and _plaintext_. You can also use: _html_, _cell_, _sound_ and _minput_.

Here you can see a really simple call example.

    // sending a query with the 'e' character
    $result = $engine->process('e');

That's all.

Sometimes a query can take a long time to execute, so you could find yourself comfortable to validate the query before make the request. The _Engine_ class has a _validate()_ method that will help you.

Here's the signature.

    public function validate($query, $assumptions = array())

**Important:** the _process()_ method returns a _QueryResult_ object. The _validate()_ method returns a _ValidateQueryResult_ object. Continue reading to know more about. 

**Important 2:** the output data format from Wolfram|Alpha Engine is XML. I used PHP's SimpleXML to work with XML nodes. If you need to work with XML too, every class (except for the _Image_ class) has the _parsedXml_ property, a _SimpleXMLElement_ instance. This means that, if you want, you can work with XML everywhere, with or without our classes.

    // output echo
    echo $result->parsedXml->asXML();
    
    // saving XML output on a file
    $result->parsedXML->asXML($fileName);

## The QueryResult

The _QueryResult_ class contains everything you need to work with your response. First of all, let's take a look the the basics methods.

### Attributes

You can access to every single query result attribute just specifying it as a property.

    var_dump($result->success);

I used magic methods to add a more simple and useful syntax. You can find every single attribute on the [reference page of the documentation](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation.html#8).

### Useful Methods

It's not just about attributes, however. I added some useful methods to control warnings, errors and so on.

#### Errors and Warnings

In Wolfram|Alpha you can have many kinds of issues in your output. As you can easily imagine, a **warning** is different than an **error**.

In fact, a Warning does not break the procedure. An error does.

With the _hasWarnings()_ and _getWarnings()_ you can deal with warnings in your code. Here's an example.

    if($result->hasWarnings())
    {
        foreach($result->getWarnings() as $name => $message)
        {
            echo $name: . ' ' . $message;
        }
    }

The _hasWarnings()_ methods returns a simple boolean value. The _getWarnings()_ method returns an associative array with the $name => $message format.

#### getError()

The same you just saw for warnings goes for errors, but with a little difference... in a Wolfram|Alpha Engine request an error is always just one, in a single query.

Here's an example. The syntax should be quite easy to understand.

    if($result->hasError())
    {
        echo 'Error ' . $result->getError()['code'] . ': ' . $result->getError()['message'];
    }

#### hasProblems()

Another "check" method is _hasProblems()_ it's used just to control the status of the _success_ attribute of the _queryresult_ XML item. It returns a boolean.

    if($result->hasProblems())
    {
        // deal with it...
    }

#### Tips and Suggestions

You know, the Wolfram|Alpha Engine is a really good, good guy. It does not only some dirty maths and processing for you, but also sometimes suggests you what you can mean if you write something wrong.

**Tips** are used if you typed something wrong and the Engine didn't understand it. _getTips()_ is a method that returns an array of strings that you can use like this:

    if(count($result->getTips()) > 0)
    {
        foreach($result->getTips() as $tip)
        {
            echo 'Tip: ' . $tip;
        }
    }

**Suggestions** are a little more specific. If a tip gives you an advice for using the Engine in a right way, a suggestion is something like "oh, you wrote Chucago, but I think you might intend Chicago!"

You can check out for suggestions with the _getSuggestions()_ method.

    if(count($result->getSuggestions()) > 0)
    {
        foreach($result->getSuggestions() as $suggestion)
        {
            echo 'Suggestion: ' . $suggestion;
        }
    }

## Pods and Subpods

In the Wolfram|Alpha world, results are organized in Pods. You can see them as "elements" that makes up the final result in its complexity. Every Pod, also, has one or more Subpods. A Subpod is the single "unit" of the result. It can be a text, or an image (and so on).

With the Wrapper, reading results of your request is very easy.

First of all, you can access your Pods with the _pods_ property.

    $pods = $result->pods;

**Note:** if the query hasn't pods, _$result->pods_ will be _null_. Check it with _isset()_, if needed.

_$pods_ is an instance of _PodsCollection_ class. It's a special object, as you can treat it like an array (thanks to the _ArrayAccess_ and _Countable_ interfaces) but also has other methods.

Let's make an example:

    // counting result pods
    echo count($result->pods);
    
    // access a specific Pod
    var_dump($result->pods['Input']);
    
However, sometimes is not so useful to iterate in the array until you find the Pod you need. The _PodsCollection_ class has also some utility methods to have a more expressive code. These methods are _has()_ and _find()_.

    if($pods->has('Input'))
    {
        $inputPod = $pods->find('input');
    }

As you can imagine, _has()_ takes the id of the desired Pod as an input and returns _true_ if the Pod exists, _false_ otherwise. _find()_ takes the same parameter as input and returns an instance of the _Pod_ class if exists, _null_ otherwise.

Talking about Pods, however, a _PodsCollection_ is a collection of _Pod_ instances.

### Pod Class

The _Pod_ class is an abstraction of the result Pod that you can easily use in your application. You can access every Pod attribute as a property:

    echo $pod->title;
    echo $pod->id;
    echo $pod->position;

... and so on.

You can access your Subpods with:

    $pod->subpods;

_subpods_ is a simple array of _Subpod_ objects.

### Subpod Class

A Pod has its own Subpods. A Subpod has its own values.

You can access to your Subpod values like this:

    // access to a simple element
    echo $subpod->plaintext;

Also, you could have an image as a result in a subpod. In this case, the image data will be wrapped in an _Image_ object.

    $image = $subpod->img;
    
    echo $image->src;

Available properties for an image are: _src_, _width_, _height_, _title_ and _alt_.

**Tip:** when you want to work with a Subpod value but you're not sure about its existence, use a simple

    if(isset($subpod->plaintext))
    {
        // ready to go!
    }

## Assumptions

Assumptions are the way Wolfram|Alpha tells you "hey, I have some results but what you asked me means many different things!". It is a different concept from "suggestions", remember.

As happened for Pods, you can access (if they exists) assumptions for your query with:

    $assumptions = $result->assumptions;

**Note:** if the query hasn't assumptions, _$result->assumptions_ will be _null_. Check it with _isset()_, if needed.

The _$result->assumptions_ will be an instance of _AssumptionsCollection_ class. Same thing for the _PodsCollection_ class: you can iterate in it as an array and count its elements with a simple _count()_.

    foreach($assumptions as $type => $assumption)
    {
        echo 'Type: ' . $type;
        
        // deal with assumptions here...
    }

You can also use _has()_ and _find()_ methods, with the same flavour you saw before in _PodsCollection_.

    if($assumptions->has('Clash'))
    {
        $assumption = $assumptions->find('Clash');
        
        // your awesome code goes here
    }

Every element in the _AssumptionsCollection_ will be an instance of the _Assumption_ class.

### Assumption and AssumptionValue

Dealing with assumptions is quite easy with these classes. First of all, you can access the assumption attributes as object properties:

    echo $assumption->type;

In the same way a Pod has its own Subpods, an Assumption has its own Assumption values. You can find them in the _$assumption->values_ as an associative array of _AssumptionValue_ instances, where the key is the name of the value.

Same thing for attributes access, and here's an example:

    $assumptionValue = $assumption->values['Character'];
    
    echo $assumptionValue->desc;
    // outputs: a character
    
    echo $assumptionValue->input;
    // outputs: *C.eta-_*Character-

**Note:** once you have the assumption value input, you can apply to a new request specifying the string contained in _$assumptionValue->input_ as an element of the _$assumptions_ array in the _process()_ method of the _Engine_ class.

## The ValidateQueryResult

Sometimes, a complete process with the Wolfram|Alpha Engine can take a lot of time. You may find useful to know that, if you want, you can just validate a query instead of giving it to the engine without know what will happen.

The _Engine_ class has a _validate_ method that will solve the problem. It is similar to the _process()_ method, as you saw before, just without some parameters. You can specify some assumptions, if you want.

The _validate()_ method will return a _ValidateQueryResult_ instance, a little bit lighter than a _QueryResult_ object as it will contain only warnings, error data and assumptions.

**Note:** using the _validate()_ method it's not about saving some API calls but processing time. So, think that if you want to validate a query and then process it, it will cost you two API calls.
